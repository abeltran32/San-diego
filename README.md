This was my undergraduate honours project at Heriot-Watt University, submitted April 2016. 

This repository contains the [final report](/final_report.pdf), [image files](/Images/), [computer-aided design (CAD) files and engineering drawings of the concepts](/CAD_files/). CAD files and drawings were produced using [PTC CREO Parametric 3.0](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/cad/creo/parametric) and [CorelDRAW](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/).

## Abstract

The main features of paper-based microfluidic devices are hydrophilic channels surrounded by a hydrophobic agent which leads to test zones containing reagents for colorimetric tests. These devices are used in diagnostics as they are small, lightweight, inexpensive, rapid and are point-of-care devices which only require a small volume of fluid. Paper has many advantages, including having the ability to transport liquids through capillary action. For animal disease diagnostics, a device which is able to test a large number of samples quickly and provides accurate results is necessary in order to identify and prevent further spread of diseases. The aim of this project is to develop paper-based microfluidic devices to be used extensively in biomedical applications for animal disease diagnostics while also addressing the key challenge faced by researchers with regards to three-dimensional devices in transporting fluid vertically through multiple layers. This journal details activities including literature review, design, fabrication, testing and results, completed throughout the course of the project as well as further activities and recommendations for the future. A number of prototypes were made for the three design concepts and testing produced promising results solving the key challenge.
